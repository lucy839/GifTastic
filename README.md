## Conflicts & Solution
-   Incorporating favorites and download button was extremely challenging. These conflicts are partially fixed. 
    Download button was not possible at that time because of giphy site's restriction. Favorites button was added to 
    each item, but replacing with delete button once they are added to favorites were still unsolved. 

## Techinical Approach
-   javascript, jQuery (especialky onclick function, and api (ajax) 
## Future
-   Resolve download and delete buttons that are still remaining as conflicts
